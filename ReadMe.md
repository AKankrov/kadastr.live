# Introduction

This project is not what you think it is.

[DZK](https://dzk.gov.ua/) developers might not even know about this project, it does not
use data from [data.land.gov.ua](https://data.land.gov.ua/). 
Don't use data as an official source of information.

The only initial goal was to collect parcel addresses for the
[OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) project.

There are no plans to do something with data or setup regular updates, 
but author can give you whatever raw data you want.
